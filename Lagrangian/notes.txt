Visualizing the uncertainty for the Double Gyre data set. 

Verifying the benefits of using feature-guided seed placement. Comparing feature-guided seed placement to uncertainty guided seed placement. 

Data set info:

Spatial information:
Assume base grid resolution of 256 x 128 = 32,768 grid points. 

Sample using 1:4, 1:16, 1:64
These correspond to:
1:4 is 8,192 samples >> 128 x 64  
1:16 is 2,048 samples >> 64 x 32 
1:64 is 512 samples >> 32 x 16 

Temporal information:
Step size = 0.01
Period = 10
Cycles in 1 period = 1000

Intervals = 1 >> 10 flow maps for 1 period. 
Intervals = 2 >> 5 flow maps for 1 period. 

Test information:
10000 random seeds in the domain. With test particles along the boundary (200 in x, 100 in y).
